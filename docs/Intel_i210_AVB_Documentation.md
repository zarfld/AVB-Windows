# Intel i210 AVB Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information on the AVB (Audio Video Bridging) functionality, configuration, and usage specific to Intel i210 Ethernet adapters.

## AVB Functionality

### Generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP)
gPTP ensures time synchronization between AVB devices. The Intel i210 supports gPTP, which is essential for maintaining precise timing across the network.

### Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP)
AVTP handles the streaming of audio and video data over AVB networks. The Intel i210 supports AVTP, enabling real-time transmission of multimedia content.

### AV Device Enumeration, Discovery, Connection Management (AVDECC)
AVDECC manages and controls devices on the AVB network. The Intel i210 supports AVDECC, allowing for the enumeration and management of AVB streams.

## Configuration

### Custom Driver Installation
To enable AVB functionality on the Intel i210, a custom driver must be installed. Follow these steps:

1. Download the custom driver package from the repository.
2. Extract the package to a desired location.
3. Open Device Manager and locate the Intel i210 NIC.
4. Right-click on the device and select "Update driver".
5. Choose "Browse my computer for drivers" and navigate to the extracted driver package.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Time Synchronization Configuration
To configure gPTP for time synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Download and run the gPTP daemon from the repository.
3. Monitor the synchronization status using the provided tools.

### Stream Configuration
To configure AVTP streams, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Use the provided AVBTool to create and manage AVTP streams.
3. Monitor the stream status and adjust settings as needed.

## Usage

### Best Practices
- Ensure all AVB devices on the network support gPTP for accurate time synchronization.
- Use high-quality network cables and switches to minimize latency and packet loss.
- Regularly monitor the network status and adjust configurations as needed.

### Examples
- Example 1: Configuring a gPTP daemon for time synchronization.
- Example 2: Creating and managing AVTP streams using AVBTool.

2. Extract the package to a desired location.
3. Open Device Manager and locate the Intel i210 NIC.
4. Right-click on the device and select "Update driver".
5. Choose "Browse my computer for drivers" and navigate to the extracted driver package.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Configuring gPTP Synchronization

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Download and run the gPTP daemon from the repository.
3. Monitor the synchronization status using the provided tools.

### Configuring Priority Queuing

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Use the provided AVBTool to configure priority queuing for AVTP streams.
3. Monitor the stream status and adjust settings as needed.

### Configuring Traffic Shaping

## Integrating Code Quality Tools in the CI Pipeline

To ensure code quality, integrate tools like static analyzers, linters, and code formatters into your CI pipeline.

### Static Code Analysis with PVS-Studio

PVS-Studio is a static code analyzer for C, C++, C#, and Java. It can be integrated into your CI pipeline to detect potential errors.

Example Step:

```yaml
    - name: Run PVS-Studio Analysis
      run: |
        # Install PVS-Studio
        choco install pvs-studio

        # Run analysis
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\PVS-Studio\PVS-Studio_Cmd.exe" \
          --target "AVB_Windows.sln" \
          --configuration "Release" \
          --output "PVS-Studio.log"
```

### Code Formatting with Clang-Format

Use Clang-Format to enforce consistent code style.

Example Step:

```yaml
    - name: Check Code Formatting
      run: |
        choco install llvm

        clang-format -i -style=file **/*.cpp **/*.h

        git diff --exit-code
```

If there are formatting differences, the git diff command will exit with a non-zero status, causing the build to fail.
