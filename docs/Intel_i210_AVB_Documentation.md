# Intel i210 AVB Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information on the AVB (Audio Video Bridging) functionality, configuration, and usage specific to Intel i210 Ethernet adapters.

## AVB Functionality

### Generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP)
gPTP ensures time synchronization between AVB devices. The Intel i210 supports gPTP, which is essential for maintaining precise timing across the network.

### Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP)
AVTP handles the streaming of audio and video data over AVB networks. The Intel i210 supports AVTP, enabling real-time transmission of multimedia content.

### AV Device Enumeration, Discovery, Connection Management (AVDECC)
AVDECC manages and controls devices on the AVB network. The Intel i210 supports AVDECC, allowing for the enumeration and management of AVB streams.

## Configuration

### Custom Driver Installation
To enable AVB functionality on the Intel i210, a custom driver must be installed. Follow these steps:

1. Download the custom driver package from the repository.
2. Extract the package to a desired location.
3. Open Device Manager and locate the Intel i210 NIC.
4. Right-click on the device and select "Update driver".
5. Choose "Browse my computer for drivers" and navigate to the extracted driver package.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Time Synchronization Configuration
To configure gPTP for time synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Download and run the gPTP daemon from the repository.
3. Monitor the synchronization status using the provided tools.

### Stream Configuration
To configure AVTP streams, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the custom driver is installed and the Intel i210 NIC is properly configured.
2. Use the provided AVBTool to create and manage AVTP streams.
3. Monitor the stream status and adjust settings as needed.

## Usage

### Best Practices
- Ensure all AVB devices on the network support gPTP for accurate time synchronization.
- Use high-quality network cables and switches to minimize latency and packet loss.
- Regularly monitor the network status and adjust configurations as needed.

### Examples
- Example 1: Configuring a gPTP daemon for time synchronization.
- Example 2: Creating and managing AVTP streams using AVBTool.
- Example 3: Enumerating and managing AVB devices using AVDECC.
